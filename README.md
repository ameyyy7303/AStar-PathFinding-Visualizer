# A* Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a Python-based interactive visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm, built with PyGame. It demonstrates how the A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between two points in a grid with obstacles. This project is ideal for learning about pathfinding, algorithms, and graphical user interfaces in Python.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to set start and end points, and draw barriers to create custom mazes.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the A* algorithm explore the grid and find the optimal path step by step.
- **Reset and Experiment**: Easily clear the grid and try different scenarios.
- **Clean, Modular Code**: Well-structured Python code, easy to read and extend for new features or algorithms.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the visualizer:

```bash
python astar.py
```

## How to Use

- **Left Click**: Set the start point, end point, and draw barriers (in that order).
- **Right Click**: Remove a point or barrier.
- **SPACE**: Start the A* pathfinding visualization.
- **C**: Clear the grid and reset.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the A* pathfinding algorithm and its heuristic approach.
- Gain experience with event-driven programming and GUI development in Python.
- Learn about grid-based data structures and visualization techniques.

## Project Structure

- `astar.py`: Main script containing all logic for the grid, visualization, and A* algorithm.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
